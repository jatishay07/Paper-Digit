# 🧠 Paper Digit

A computer vision algorithm used to detect single numbers, combined with a **custom-built Neural Network** trained on the **MNIST dataset** to identify and predict digits shown through a webcam feed.  

The project integrates **OpenCV** for real-time detection and preprocessing with a **NumPy-based neural network** that can be expanded with user-labeled data.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time digit detection** using OpenCV  
- **Neural Network trained on MNIST** for number recognition  
- **Human feedback loop** — capture, label, and grow your dataset interactively  
- **Retraining support** — retrain your model as new samples are added  
- **Preprocessing pipeline** — automatic cropping, resizing, and normalization

## 🧪 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### 2️⃣ Run the webcam digit detector
```bash
python scr/model/webcam.py
```

- Press **SPACE** to capture a frame.  
- The system will ask you to input the digit (0–9).  
- The preprocessed ROI (Region of Interest) is automatically saved to:  
  ```
  custom_digits/<digit>/
  ```

### 3️⃣ Retrain the model
After collecting 100–200 labeled samples:
```bash
python scr/model/train.py
```
This retrains the network using both **MNIST** and your **custom digits**.

## 🧠 Model Overview
- Input: 28×28 grayscale images  
- Hidden layers: Configurable in `config.py`  
- Activation: Sigmoid / ReLU  
- Output: 10 neurons (digits 0–9)  
- Optimizer: Gradient Descent  
- Training dataset: MNIST  

---

## 📸 Workflow
1. The webcam captures an image.  
2. OpenCV finds the region of interest (ROI) containing the digit.  
3. The ROI is preprocessed (grayscale, resized, normalized).  
4. The neural network predicts the number shown.  
5. You can manually label new digits for future retraining.

---

## 🧱 Future Enhancements
- Add a **“none” class** to ignore non-digit frames  
- Implement **continuous learning / retraining loop**  
- Integrate **CNN layers** for improved accuracy  
- Add **confidence visualization** or a simple GUI interface
